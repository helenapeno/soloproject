# soloproject
For my soloproject I plan to use a python application that allows users to create and edit grocery lists, with a functionality to drop purchased items into a seperate list of "purchased items" that will allow the user to add them back into the "current needs" list. The user will aslo be able to create and remove items from these list, for one time purchases or less frequently purchased items. Each item will allow users to add details such as prefered brand names, item type (dairy, produce, snack food).
